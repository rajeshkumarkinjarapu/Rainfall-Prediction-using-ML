## Abstract :
Heavy rainfall prediction is a major problem for meteorological department as it is closely associated with the economy and life of human. It is a cause for natural disasters like flood and drought which are encountered by people across the globe every year. Accuracy of rainfall forecasting has great importance for countries like India whose economy is largely dependent on agriculture. Due to dynamic nature of atmosphere, Statistical techniques fail to provide good accuracy for rainfall forecasting. Nonlinearity of rainfall data makes Machine learning a better technique. Review work and comparison of different approaches and algorithms used by researchers for rainfall prediction is shown. Intention of this project is to give non-experts easy access to the techniques and approaches used in the field of rainfall prediction.

## 🌧️ Rainfall Prediction using Machine Learning:
This project aims to predict rainfall using various weather-related features such as temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, and more. It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and model building using popular ML algorithms.

## 📁 Dataset Features
--day

--pressure

--temparature

--dewpoint

--humidity
--cloud
--rainfall
--sunshine
--winddirection

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
--Histograms to visualize distribution of features.
--Scatter plots to understand relationships with rainfall.
--Line plot of rainfall over days.
--Boxplots and heatmaps for outliers and correlations.

## 🤖 ML Models Used:
--Logistic Regression
